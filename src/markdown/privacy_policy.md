## Privacy Policy for Thunder
This Privacy Policy describes how Thunder (“the App”) collects, processes, and protects user information. By using Thunder, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined below.

### 1. Data Collection and Usage

#### 1.1. No Collection of Personal Data
Thunder does not collect, track, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) or user data. The App functions as a client for third-party Lemmy servers, and all interactions occur directly between your device and the selected Lemmy instance.

Thunder does not manage, control, or have access to the data stored on or processed by third-party Lemmy servers. Users are responsible for reviewing and understanding the privacy policies of the Lemmy instances they connect to.

#### 1.2. Locally Stored Data
Thunder stores necessary data locally on your device to facilitate functionality, including:

- Authentication tokens – Required for logging into third-party Lemmy servers and maintaining active sessions.
- User preferences and app settings – To retain customization options and improve user experience.
- Cached content – To enhance performance and minimize redundant network requests.

Thunder does not upload, sync, or transmit this locally stored data to any external servers or cloud services without your explicit consent.

### 2. Permissions
#### 2.1. Device Permissions
To ensure core functionality, Thunder may request permission to access certain device features, including:

- Storage Access: To store authentication tokens, cached content, and app preferences.
- Network Access: To facilitate communication with third-party Lemmy servers.

All permissions requested by Thunder are strictly used to provide the intended functionality and do not result in data collection, storage, or transmission by the App.

### 3. Data Security
#### 3.1. Encryption and Protection
Thunder may implement encryption or other security measures to safeguard locally stored authentication tokens and other app data. However, any data transmitted to or stored by third-party Lemmy servers is subject to their respective security policies, over which Thunder has no control.

#### 3.2. Data Retention and Deletion
When Thunder is uninstalled, all locally stored app data, including authentication tokens and cached content, is permanently removed from your device.

However, any content, posts, or interactions submitted to third-party Lemmy servers remain on those servers and are subject to their respective data retention policies. Users must directly contact the administrators of the relevant Lemmy instance to request data deletion from their servers.

### 4. Third-Party Services and External Links
#### 4.1. Third-Party Lemmy Servers
Thunder enables users to connect to independently operated third-party Lemmy servers. Thunder does not manage, oversee, or assume responsibility for these servers’ privacy practices, security measures, or data handling procedures.

Users are strongly encouraged to review the privacy policies and terms of service of any Lemmy server they choose to interact with.

#### 4.2. External Links
Thunder may contain links to third-party websites or services. This Privacy Policy applies solely to Thunder and does not cover third-party platforms. Thunder disclaims responsibility for the data collection, privacy policies, or security practices of any external websites or services. Users should review the privacy policies of external services before providing any personal information.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in legal requirements, security standards, or operational needs. In the event of significant modifications, we will provide notice through the App or other appropriate means.

Continued use of Thunder following any updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
